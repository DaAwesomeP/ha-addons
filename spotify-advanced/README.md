# DaAwesomeP Home Assistant Add-on: Spotify Connect Advanced

[![Release][release-shield]][release] ![Project Stage][project-stage-shield] ![Project Maintenance][maintenance-shield]

Play Spotify music on your Home Assistant device (with more options and events).

## About

This is a fork of [hassio-addons/addon-spotify-connect](original). It adds
a few more features, like all of the LibreSpot options and events in Home
Assistant.

The Home Assistant Spotify Connect add-on allows you to use your device
running Home Assistant to play your Spotify music. This add-on uses the
Spotify Connect protocol, which makes it show up a device that can be
controlled by all the official clients.

For example; Running Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi with this add-on
installed will allow you to play your Spotify music via the Pi. So all
you'll have to do is hook up your sound system to the Pi!
